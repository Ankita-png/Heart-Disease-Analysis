# Heart-Disease-Analysis
Cleveland Heart Disease data is a famous data of patients having/not having heart disease along with 14 features. The link for the data can be found in the HTML file.

I have tried to perform an analysis to predict whether a patient will suffer from heart disease or not based on his/her given features. The analysis will be having the following headings :

+ **Introduction** - Here a general knowledge about Heart Disease and Machine Learning is provided along with the links to get to the data. I have also mentioned about what is my aim in this analysis.

+ **The Data** - In this section all types of details about the data is provided along with a glimpse of the data. The features have also been defined along with their abbreviations as used in the data.

+ **Objectives** - I have the two following objectives for the data as :
  - Q1. How being affected by heart disease is related to the features (categorical) of a person?
  - Q2. Find a model to predict heart disease of a patient given the features.\
But my main objective is Q2 have the entire analysis will be focused on this objective.

+ **The Approach** - In this part the approaches that will be used for performing objective 2 has been mentioned and they are :
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Random Forest
  
+ **Data Analysis for Objective 1** - From this section my analysis on the Cleveland Heart Disease data have been started. This part is only for objective 1, which includes Correlation Matrix Plot and some Bar Plots. The details of this analysis will be obtained in the HTML file.

+ **Data Analysis for Objective 2** - In this part of analysis, the different models are created using the training set and are fitted on the testing set. For each of the approaches Confusion Matrix is evaluated and I have tried to draw conclusion using values obtained from this part of analysis. The overall Accuracy and the F1 score values are mainly drawn attention to for concluding about the predictions and the best model to be used.

+ **Conclusion** - This part is an official conclusion about the above analysis and the model(s) that may be used for our predictions.
